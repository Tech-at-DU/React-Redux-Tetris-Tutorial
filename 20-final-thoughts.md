# 🏁 P20 – Final Thoughts

🎉 Congratulations! You've built a fully functional Tetris clone using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.

This wasn’t just about coding a game — it was about learning to:
✅ Manage complex UI state using Redux  
✅ Build modular, component-based interfaces  
✅ Handle real-time updates, user input, and game logic

---

## 🎮 What You Built
- A classic falling-block game with:
  - Rotating, moving, and dropping pieces
  - Real-time grid rendering
  - Score, level, and lines cleared tracking
  - Game over detection and restart
- A polished user experience, all in the browser!

---

## 💡 What You Learned
- Functional UI patterns with React components
- Centralized state with Redux Toolkit
- Real-time updates with `useEffect` + `setInterval`
- Keyboard interaction and game loop architecture
- Collision logic and board manipulation
