# 🧱 P00 – Introduction to React + Redux Tetris

Welcome to the Tetris Tutorial! 🎮  
You’re about to build the classic falling-block game using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, combining **real-time logic**, **grid-based rendering**, and **state management** into one fun and engaging app.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Build
By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have:
- A fully playable Tetris clone in the browser
- Responsive keyboard controls
- A dynamic grid-based game board
- Score and level tracking
- Block rotation and game-over detection

All while writing clean, modular, and maintainable code!

## 💻 What You’ll Learn
This project is designed to teach you:
- ⚛️ How to structure a React app using components
- 🧠 How to manage game state with Redux Toolkit
- ⌨️ How to capture and handle keyboard input
- 📦 How to use slices, actions, and reducers effectively
- 🕹️ How to simulate a real-time game loop

---

## 🧠 AI Prompt Examples
Use AI to deepen your understanding as you go:
- *“How does Tetris handle collision detection on a grid?”*
- *“Help me debug my reducer for rotating blocks.”*
- *“How do I optimize my render logic to avoid unnecessary re-renders?”*

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- Basic knowledge of **React** (components, props, state)
- Basic familiarity with **Redux** (actions, reducers, store)
- **Node.js + npm** installed on your computer

## 🔧 How This Tutorial Works
Each folder in the tutorial represents a step in building the game. You’ll:
1. Start with layout and simple components
2. Add Redux for centralized state
3. Connect UI to game logic
4. Implement real-time updates and controls
5. Finish with polish, scorekeeping, and game over behavior

Each step includes code, explanations, and challenges. You'll also find AI prompts and stretch goals to explore ideas further.
