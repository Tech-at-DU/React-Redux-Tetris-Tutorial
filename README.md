# 🎮 React + Redux Tetris Tutorial

Welcome to the **Tetris Game Tutorial** built with **React** and **Redux**! In this step-by-step project, you'll implement a fully interactive version of the classic game while learning:

✅ Component-based UI design  
✅ Game state management with Redux Toolkit  
✅ Keyboard input and timers in React  
✅ Grid-based logic and block rotations

---

## 🧱 What You’ll Build
A playable Tetris clone where users can:
- Move and rotate falling blocks
- Complete lines to earn points
- Watch their score and next piece
- See game over conditions and restart

---

## 🔧 What You’ll Learn
- Using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` with Redux
- Organizing game state and reducers
- Creating a live game loop with `setInterval`
- React component design and conditional rendering
- Keyboard event handling with `useEffect`
