# 🎮 Build Tetris with React & Redux

Welcome! In this tutorial, you’ll build a fully functional version of **Tetris** using **React** and **Redux Toolkit** — one step at a time.

You'll start with a basic React app and work all the way up to a polished, interactive game with score tracking, keyboard controls, and automatic block dropping.

This tutorial is **hands-on** and **code-first**. After each short page, your game will still run — no broken builds, no skipped logic. You'll also find:

- 🤖 **AI Prompts** to help you explore concepts deeper  
- 🧠 **Check for Understanding** to reinforce learning  
- ✅ **Working Code** after every step

## 🗂️ Tutorial Outline

Each step builds on the one before it:

### 🛠️ Setup and Layout
- [00-Introduction](./00-Introduction.md) – Set up your React app
- [01-Grid-Square](./01-Grid-Square.md) – Create the basic square component
- [02-Grid-Board](./02-Grid-Board.md) – Build a 10×18 game board
- [03-Next-Block](./03-Next-Block.md) – Add the next shape preview
- [04-Score-Board](./04-Score-Board.md) – Display score and game controls
- [05-Arranging-the-Page](./05-Arranging-the-Page.md) – Use CSS Grid for layout
- [06-Controls](./06-Controls.md) – Add movement buttons
- [07-Message-Popup](./07-Message-Popup.md) – Display pause and game over messages

### 🧠 State Management with Redux
- [08-Redux-Toolkit](./08-Redux-Toolkit.md) – Set up the Redux store
- [09-Organizing-Code](./09-Organizing-Code.md) – Move helpers to a `utils` folder
- [10-Default-State](./10-Default-State.md) – Define initial game state

### 🔌 Connecting Components to State
- [11-Connect-Next-Block](./11-Connect-Next-Block.md) – Pull shape data from Redux
- [12-Connecting-Grid-Board](./12-Connecting-Grid-Board.md) – Draw the board dynamically
- [13-connect-Controls](./13-connect-Controls.md) – Hook up controls to actions
- [14-Connect-Message-Popup](./14-Connect-Message-Popup.md) – Show pause and game over states
- [15-Connect-Score-Board](./15-Connect-Score-Board.md) – Connect score and control buttons

### 🎮 Game Logic
- [16-Rotating-Blocks](./16-Rotating-Blocks.md) – Add rotation logic  
- [17-Moving-Blocks](./17-Moving-Blocks.md) – Move blocks and place them  
- [18-Creating-a-Timer](./18-Creating-a-Timer.md) – Drop blocks over time  
- [19-Game-Over-and-Restart](./19-Game-Over-and-Restart.md) – End and restart the game

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Core React concepts: components, props, and hooks  
- Redux Toolkit: slices, state, and dispatch  
- Grid-based rendering logic  
- Game loop timing with `requestAnimationFrame`  
- UI layout using CSS Grid
