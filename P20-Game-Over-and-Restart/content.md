1. **Implementing Game Over and Restart**
    1. **Handle the behavior of Controls in relation to the game over state**
    1. **Handle the game over state in the `addBlockToGrid` function to know if the blocks are off the screen**
    1. **Modify `game-reducer` to handle the game over state**
    1. **Modify `game-reducer` to handle the restart state**

If the blocks stack to the top of the screen, it's game over. We need to make sure we can handle this state.

Let's take a closer look at `state`:

- `grid` : An array describing the game board. This contains all of the squares that have been placed. It does not contain the current block that you are controlling.
- `shape` : The index of the current shape that you are controlling. The index identifies the array of shapes for each rotation in the shape array.
- `rotation` : The index of the rotation for the current block.
- `x` : horizontal position of the shape you are controlling.
- `y` : vertical position of the shape you are controlling.
- `nextShape` : index of the next shape that will appear after
the current shape is placed.
- **`isRunning`** : when true, the game is running, false when the
game is paused.
- **`gameOver`** : true when the game is over.
- `speed` : the number of milliseconds before a block is moved down.
- `score` : your score

`isRunning` and `gameOver` are the two important properties for this discussion, let's go over the basic rules of these properties:

- `isRunning` is is set by the Play/Resume button. When `isRunning` is false, the game is paused but not over.
- On the other hand when `gameOver` is true the game is over.
- The controls should not issue actions when `isRunning` is
false or `gameOver` is true.
- The move down action that forces the game along should also
not happen when `isRunning` is false or `gameOver` is true.
- `gameOver` is set to false by default. It gets set to true
when the game is over.
- A game is over when a block is added to the grid and part if that block ends up off the top edge of the grid.

# Handle gameOver in the controls component

Here you need to disable the controls when the `gameOver` property on `state` is false.

> [action]
>
> Use the `useSelector` hook in `/src/components/Controls.js`:
>
> Import useSelector and then get the isRunning and gameOver values from state. 
> 
```js
...
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
...
export default function Controls(props) {
	const dispatch = useDispatch()
	const isRunning = useSelector((state) => state.game.isRunning)
	const gameOver = useSelector((state) => state.game.gameOver) 
>
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

The `onClick` handler for each function should check
`isRunning` and `gameOver`. If `isRunning` is `false`
or `gameOver` is `true` the buttons should not send actions.

> [action]
>
> Update all of the `button` elements in the `return` block of `/src/components/controls.js` to check `isRunning` and `gameOver` before dispatching their actions. 
>
```js
...
>
export default function Controls(props) {
	...
>
	return (
		<div className="controls">
			{/* left */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(moveLeft())
			}}>Left</button>
>
			{/* right */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(moveRight())
			}}>Right</button>
>
			{/* rotate */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(rotate())
			}}>Rotate</button>
>
			{/* down */}
			<button className="control-button" onClick={(e) => {
				if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
				dispatch(moveDown())
			}}>Down</button>
>
		</div>
	)
}
```

With these changes the controls will not work when the game is paused or over. You haven't solved the game over situation yet, soon! For now when game is paused the blocks should not move or rotate when the controls are used. 

There is a small problem. When the game is paused the buttons look like they should work. Visually they look the same as when the game is not paused.

Button has an attribute: disabled that disables a button when true. 

> [action]
>
> Update `/src/components/controls.js` to check `isRunning` and `gameOver` and set the disabled attribute.
>
```js
...
>
export default function Controls(props) {
  ...
>
	return (
		<div className={`controls`}>
			{/* left */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(moveLeft())
				}}>Left</button>
>
			{/* right */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(moveRight())
				}}>Right</button>
>
			{/* rotate */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(rotate())
				}}>Rotate</button>
>
			{/* down */}
			<button 
				disabled={!isRunning || gameOver}
				className="control-button" 
				onClick={(e) => {
					if (!isRunning || gameOver) { return } 
					dispatch(moveDown())
				}}>Down</button>
>
		</div>
	)
}
```
>

With this change in place the buttons should disable as disbaled when the game is paused, `isRunning === false`, or over, `gameOver === false`. 

# Detecting a game over

We can detect a game over in the `addBlockToGrid`
function `utils/index.js`

The `addBlockToGrid()` function adds a block to the grid. If part of the block ends up off the top the grid the game is over.

The goal is to have the function return the new grid and a bool that says the game is over (true) or the game is not over (false). Since we can only return one value from a function, the return type will have to change to an object with two properties: `grid` and `gameOver`.

> [action]
>
> In `/src/utils/index.js`, update `addBlockToGrid` to the following:
>
```JavaScript
// Adds current shape to grid
export const addBlockToGrid = (shape, grid, x, y, rotation) => {
  // At this point the game is not over
  let blockOffGrid = false
  const block = shapes[shape][rotation]
  const newGrid = [ ...grid ]
  for (let row = 0; row < block.length; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < block[row].length; col++) {
      if (block[row][col]) {
        const yIndex = row + y
        // If the yIndex is less than 0 part of the block
        // is off the top of the screen and the game is over
        if (yIndex < 0) {
          blockOffGrid = true
        } else {
          newGrid[row + y][col + x] = shape
        }
      }
    }
  }
  // Return both the newGrid and the gameOver bool                                                
  return { grid: newGrid, gameOver: blockOffGrid }
}
```

Changing this will mean changes to the reducer and the
MOVE_DOWN case where this method is called.

# Modify the game-reducer

> [action]
>
> Modify the MOVE_DOWN case for `/src/reducers/game-reducer.js`:
>
```JavaScript
case MOVE_DOWN:
  // Get the next potential Y position
  const maybeY = y + 1
>
  // Check if the current block can move here
  if (canMoveTo(shape, grid, x, maybeY, rotation)) {
      // If so move down don't place the block
      return { ...state, y: maybeY }
  }
>
  // If not place the block
  // (this returns an object with a grid and gameover bool)
  const obj = addBlockToGrid(shape, grid, x, y, rotation)
  const newGrid = obj.grid
  const gameOver = obj.gameOver
>
  if (gameOver) {
    // Game Over
    const newState = { ...state }
    newState.shape = 0
    newState.grid = newGrid
    return { ...state, gameOver: true }
  }
>
  // reset somethings to start a new shape/block
  const newState = defaultState()
  newState.grid = newGrid
  newState.shape = nextShape
  newState.score = score
  newState.isRunning = isRunning
>
  // TODO: Check and Set level
  // Score increases decrease interval
  newState.score = score + checkRows(newGrid)
>
  return newState
```

Try to force a game over and make sure you see the popup:

![gameover](assets/gameover.png)

Almost done! One more feature and we've got a full Tetris game!

# Now Commit

>[action]
>
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'game over implemented'
$ git push
```

# Restart Game-Reducer

Now that the game knows when it's ended, we need a way to restart it!

Restarting the game will only require setting the game `state` in redux back to default, and there already is a function for this!

> [action]
>
> Return default state with a call to `defaultState()` in the `RESTART` case in `/src/reducers/game-reducer.js`:
>
```js
case RESTART:
    return defaultState()
```

Try pressing the restart button and make sure it starts the game from a clean slate.

# Now Commit

>[action]
>
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'restart implemented'
$ git push
```

**You have now implemented an advanced single page application with React â€” a fully functioning Tetris game! Congrats!**

As you go through this FEW course, try to tie the concepts you learned here into the course material. The foundational work here on building React apps will be used to make bigger and bolder apps down the road!

# Challenges

## Change the styles 

The square and the buttons use a beveled/chiseled looks which doesn't look that great. This was chosen originally because it looks like the original game. But you can add a more modern and updated look with a few styles. 

Here are a few ideas to get you started. 

Remove the border on the square; 

```css
.grid-square {
  /* border-style: solid; */
  width: var(--tile-size);
  height: var(--tile-size);
  /* border-width: var(--border-width);
  border-left-color: var(--border-left-color);
  border-top-color: var(--border-top-color);
  border-right-color: var(--border-right-color);
  border-bottom-color: var(--border-bottom-color); */
}
```

Add a border radius 

```CSS
/* Grid Square */
.grid-square {
  width: var(--tile-size);
  height: var(--tile-size);
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

Add a gap between the grid squares by adding `grid-gap` to the game board styles. 

```css
/* Grid Board */
.grid-board {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(var(--cols), var(--tile-size));
  grid-gap: 0;
  align-self: flex-start;
  grid-area: c;
  grid-gap: 1px; /* Add a gap! */
}
```

You can apply the same ideas to the next block. 

Style the buttons: 

```css
/* Score Board */
.score-board-button {
  display: block;
  padding: 1em;
  background-color: var(--color-0);
  border: none;
  /* border-width: 5px; */
  /* border-top-color: var(--button-color-t);
  border-left-color: var(--button-color-l);
  border-right-color: var(--button-color-r);
  border-bottom-color: var(--button-color-b); */
}
```

You can do the same thing to the `.control-button`. Might be good to make a `.button` class and share this across both the scoreboard and control buttons. This was overlooked in the original tutorial.

The buttons in the score board are a little uneven. It would be good to arrange make these buttons so they fill the width of the side bar. You can do this with flex box. 

```CSS
/* score-board */
.score-board {
  grid-area: r;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

You can customize the colors by adjusting the color variables at the top of the style sheet: 

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: rgba(150, 150, 150, 1);

  /* Border Colors are all transparent colors. These will tint or shade the background color of the square. */
  --border-left-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.20);
  --border-top-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.33);
  --border-right-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  --border-bottom-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

  /* Square Colors:  background colors for the squares.*/
  --color-0: #eaeaea;
  --color-1: #ff6600;
  --color-2: #eec900;
  --color-3: #0000ff;
  --color-4: #cc00ff;
  --color-5: #00ff00;
  --color-6: #66ccff;
  --color-7: #ff0000;
  ...
}
```

## JS Challenges 

Looks liek the next block displays the color of the shape as color 0. It would be nice to display the shape color. Colors are mapped to an index and the index matches the index of the shape. 

The problem is the square value is 0 or 1. It's the shape index `nextShape` that should be index of the color. 

```JS
export default function NextBlock(props) {
	...
	const box = shapes[nextShape][0]
>
	const grid = box.map((rowArray, row) => {
		return rowArray.map((square, col) => {
      // make the changes here: 
			return <GridSquare key={`${row}${col}`} color={square === 0 ? 0 : nextShape} />
		})
	})
 ...
}
```

Note the change here sets the color to 0 if the `square` value is 0 or the `nextShape`. 

## Counting Completed Rows 

Besides scoring points you also remove rows of squares. Teacking the number of rows removed can be used to track score.

In some versions of the game the goal is to complete a number of rows within a given time alotment. You could use the completion of rows to decrease the speed property on state increasing the speed of the game and making play more difficult over time. 

To track the completed rows you might follow these steps: 

- Define a new property on state for rows Completed. This will need to go into the default state object in `utils/index.js`
- The checkRows function calculates the rows completed and returns a score. You'll need to modify this to return the score and the number of rows completed.
- In the `reducers/game-reducer.js` take a look at the code in MOVE_DOWN case. Near the bottom the code calls `checkRows()` if you modified the return value work with that here. Also caluclate the new row count here and set it on newState. 

## Edge Cases 

The game has a bug. When block is off the top edge of the grid if you move it left or right enough to move it off the grid the game registers this as a game over. You can try this yourself. When a block starts clicking left or right enough will cause a game over. You won't see the block. 

To track down the problem think about how the game works. Click the left or right button you're issuing an action which is in turn sent to the reducer. In the reducer a MOVE_RIGHT or MOVE_LEFT action call `canMoveTo()` which returns true or false if the shape can be moved. There is a problem here. 

Here is a refactor of the canMoveTo function. Try this on your own. You can compare your solution. 

```JS
export const canMoveTo = (shape, grid, x, y, rotation) => {
	const currentShape = shapes[shape][rotation]
	// Get the width and height of the grid
	const gridWidth = grid[0].length - 1
	const gridHeight = grid.length - 1
	// Loop over the shape array
	for (let row = 0; row < currentShape.length; row++) {
		for (let col = 0; col < currentShape[row].length; col++) {
			// If the value isn't 0 it's part of the shape
			if (currentShape[row][col] !== 0) {
				// Offset the square to map it to the larger grid
				const proposedX = col + x
				const proposedY = row + y
				// Get the possible row. This might be undefined if we're above the top
				const possibleRow = grid[proposedY]

				// Off the left or right side or off the bottom return false
				if (proposedX < 0 || proposedX > gridWidth || proposedY > gridHeight) {
					return false
				} else if (possibleRow !== undefined) {
					// If the row is not undefined you're on the grid
					if (possibleRow[proposedX] !== 0) {
						// This square must be filled
						return false
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

## User interactions 

The game is working but the user interface needs some attention. While clicking the buttons works it would be better and more playable to be able to use the keyboard.

Think about which keys would make sense for controls. The left and right arrows make sense to work with the left and right actions. The rotate action might be the space bar or the down and or the up arrow. The W, A, S, and D keys are also classic controls for games. 

using the keyboard you could intrduce a positive and negative rotation. Currently the rotation is only in the positive direction. There is a only one button which limits how the game can handle rotation. With the key board the down arrow could rotate in the positive direction and the up arrow could rotate in the negative direction. 

## Saving High Scores 

If you did the other React + Redux trutorials you worked with Local storage you could put these ideas to use here to save the game state and save the high score.
